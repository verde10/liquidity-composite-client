# Liquidity Composite Client

A comprehensive decentralized liquidity management and trading platform built on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Liquidity Composite Client provides an advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) solution for managing and optimizing liquidity pool interactions using Clarity smart contracts. The platform enables users to:

- Create and manage complex liquidity pool strategies
- Control access and permissions for pool interactions
- Validate and track transaction integrity
- Monitor and manage liquidity positions
- Implement advanced trading mechanisms

## Architecture

The Liquidity Composite Client consists of four core smart contracts that work together to provide comprehensive liquidity management:

### lp-core-manager
The central contract managing liquidity pool operations and core interactions. It handles:
- Liquidity pool creation and management
- Basic pool access control
- Position registration and tracking
- Dynamic fee calculation

### lp-access-control
Handles granular permissions and access management, including:
- Role-based access control for pool participants
- User and device authorization
- Pool ownership management
- Permission delegation and revocation

### lp-transaction-validator
Ensures transaction integrity and manages complex trading logic:
- Cryptographic verification of pool transactions
- Advanced trade validation
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Transaction integrity tracking

### lp-position-tracking
Manages liquidity positions and comprehensive tracking:
- Detailed position history
- Performance metrics
- Rebalancing strategies
- Comprehensive position metadata

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Store data references securely on the Stacks blockchain
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions system with role-based access
- **Data Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of synchronized content
- **Version Control**: Track and manage content versions across devices
- **Conflict Resolution**: Built-in mechanisms for handling conflicting updates
- **Device Management**: Register and manage multiple devices per user
- **Metadata Tracking**: Comprehensive metadata management for synchronized content

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions

```clarity
;; Register a new data reference
(register-reference (ref-id (string-utf8 128)) (hash (buff 32)) (version (string-utf8 32)) (metadata (optional (string-utf8 256))))

;; Update an existing reference
(update-reference (ref-id (string-utf8 128)) (hash (buff 32)) (version (string-utf8 32)) (metadata (optional (string-utf8 256))))

;; Share a reference with another user
(share-reference (ref-id (string-utf8 128)) (user principal) (can-update bool))
```

### Access Control

```clarity
;; Grant access to a dataset
(grant-access (dataset-id (string-utf8 36)) (user principal) (role-name (string-utf8 10)))

;; Register a new device
(register-device (device-id (string-utf8 36)) (device-name (string-utf8 64)))

;; Transfer dataset ownership
(transfer-ownership (dataset-id (string-utf8 36)) (new-owner principal))
```

### Integrity Management

```clarity
;; Submit a new data hash
(submit-data-hash (data-id (string-utf8 36)) (hash (buff 32)) (device-id (string-utf8 36)))

;; Verify data integrity
(verify-data (data-id (string-utf8 36)) (hash (buff 32)) (proof (buff 128)))

;; Resolve data conflicts
(resolve-conflict (data-id (string-utf8 36)) (selected-hash (buff 32)))
```

### Metadata Management

```clarity
;; Create content metadata
(create-content-metadata (content-id (string-utf8 36)) (title (string-utf8 128)) (content-type (string-utf8 32)) (size-bytes uint))

;; Add a new version
(add-content-version (content-id (string-utf8 36)) (hash (buff 32)) (device-id (string-utf8 36)) (change-description (string-utf8 256)) (size-bytes uint))

;; Update sync status
(update-sync-status (content-id (string-utf8 36)) (device-id (string-utf8 36)) (synced-version uint))
```

## Security Considerations

- All data references are stored as cryptographic hashes
- Only authorized devices can update data references
- Role-based access control enforces proper permissions
- Cryptographic proofs verify data integrity
- Conflict detection prevents data inconsistencies
- Device registration required for synchronization

## Getting Started

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain. To interact with AetherSync:

1. Deploy the smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Register devices using the access control contract
3. Create and manage data references through the core contract
4. Use the integrity contract to verify synchronized data
5. Track versions and metadata using the metadata contract

For detailed implementation and integration guidelines, refer to the individual contract documentation.
